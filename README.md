### List of Software Tools for Machine Learning

Most data scientists are using R/Python for every day work in data
munging, visualization and modeling (e.g. machine learning), but
many other tools are used as well, see e.g.
this [survey](http://datascience.la/data-science-toolbox-survey-results-surprise-r-and-python-win/) 
we did at the LA Data Science meetup. 

I'm interested in finding out more details about machine learning tools usage.
I'd like to get here a *seed* of 20-30 tools that I can ask people about at a subsequent 
LA Data Science/Machine Learning meetup (We've got much better response rates with
"quick show of hands" surveys than with sending out polls e.g. via email). Results of
the survey will be published here.

So, feel free to **contribute via github issues**. Let me know if you are using a tool that's
not already in the list below. 

I'm also interested in a taxonomy
of tools. Do we group them by supervised/unsupervised..., or used from R/Python/Hadoop..., or 
GUI/command line..., or small data/large scale..., open source/commercial, or by algo?
